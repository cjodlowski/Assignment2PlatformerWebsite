  <h2>Post Mortem</h2>
  <h3>Justin</h3>
  <p>
    There are few different things that I would change In this project if I had 8 more weeks to work on this project. 
    The first thing I would do is create a main menu and multiple different levels that could be chosen from. Maybe 
    create some different enemies and create the abstractions path for that. The next thing I would do is work 
    more on the animation cycles of different Ai fruit and the players themselves Animation is such a small thing 
    but really polishes a game. Also expanded to have more tiles.
  </p>
  <h3>Alex</h3>
  <p>
    If I had more time I would probably do some research on ways to make the collisions and movement smoother.  
    Our current method works reasonably well, but still gets hung up now and then and jitters against the walls when you run into them constantly.  
    Improving this would make the game feel more polished and consistent.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another obvious area of expansion is simply in game content.  Right now the game only has one level, 
    adding more would be a good idea.  We could also add in the ability to have a level larger than the screen, 
    and a camera that tracked the player. That would allow for much more interesting and involved levels.
  </p>
  <h3>Akash</h3>
  <p>
    Looking back at this project, I see ways that we could have changed how some of our classes work and interact each with other, 
    but it's hard to see this before actually writing the code. Refactoring the code at this point would take too much time, but for 
    future projects, we may want to plan out how everything will interact before coding things.  The resource manager is one area where 
    said improvements could have been made to further decouple the classes and allow for easier use in the future. Also, the game would 
    feel a lot more polished if we were able to implement some small quality-of-life changes, such as more sound effects and animations.
  </p>
  <h3>Claudia</h3>
  <p>
    If we were given more time to work on this assignment, there are definitely some aspects of the code we could improve. The first thing 
    would be to implement multiple stages of each level by having a camera switch between screens as the player progresses and explores the 
    levels. This would allow for more complex levels for our platformer. It would also be cool to implement different types of enemies with 
    different types of AI so that the level is more engaging. It would also be fun to create a boss the player must fight at the end of the level.
    Code wise, a good portion of our code is coupled, and while that is not necessarily a problem, it would be a good idea to abstract it further 
    and separate some classes from each other. I would also want to make collisions and movement a bit more streamlined, as there are some bugs within 
    it currently.
